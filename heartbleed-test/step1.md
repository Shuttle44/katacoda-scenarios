First, we need a few packages to get started.

##Â Task

Let's install httpd, which well serve as our webserver:
`yum install httpd`{{execute}}

We also need wget, which we will use later:
`yum install wget`{{execute}}

Perl is also needed:
`yum install perl`{{execute}}

As well as gcc:
`yum install gcc`{{execute}}

Finally, we install mod_ssl, wich enables us to encrypt connections:
`yum install mod_ssl`{{execute}}

Now we have everything we need, let's continue.
